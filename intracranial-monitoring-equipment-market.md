<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Monitoring Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Monitoring</li><li>Noninvasive Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial monitoring equipment market is divided into two main types: invasive and noninvasive monitoring. Invasive monitoring involves directly placing sensors within the skull to measure intracranial pressure and other metrics, providing precise data for critical conditions like brain injuries or hydrocephalus. Noninvasive monitoring, on the other hand, utilizes external devices such as ultrasound or MRI to assess brain function and pressure without surgical intervention. Both approaches are essential for diagnosing and managing neurological disorders effectively.</p></p>
